# CLI-tool

### What is next ?
the program will save the data in .jas*n file
and more commands like the remove command that will remove a todo

making the indexing of the tasks like be good not messed up

#### And More, Maybe

So am going to work on file saving tomorrow but first fixing the delete command that is not working
then work on the file saving
