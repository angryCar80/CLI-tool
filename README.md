> **Note**: For longer README files, I usually add a "Back to top" buttton as shown above. It makes it easy to navigate.

This is where your installation instructions go.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/angryCar80/CLI-tool.git
cd CLI-tool
```

You have people who want to use your project and then you have people who want contribute to your project.
